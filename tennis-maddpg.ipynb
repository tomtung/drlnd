For this simple problem, using MADDPG doesn't necessarily seem to improve convergence speed, but it's interesting to see how agents with different behaviors are able to cooperate and bounce the ball back and forth.\n",

    "Andrychowicz et al. (2020) suggested that it's helpful to initialize the final layer of the actor network with small weights so that initially actions depend little on the observations. They suggested doing the same for the critic network doesn't seem to be useful, but it turns out that for this particular problem it does seem to help, too. This is probably because during the initial training state the expected accumulative reward is always close to 0 anyways."
